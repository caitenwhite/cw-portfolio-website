        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
            I am a non-binary self-taught programmer, and aspiring leader who has been working in the SaaS industry since 2016. Being self-taught means I am very used to getting scrappy and learning core skills quickly - I started out learning Python, but dived into Ruby to work for my New Relic team, and learned Go and Kubernetes in order to work for Heroku.
